NEURONGLIGHTSTATUS is a widget that has been designed to run on Frsky Radios; directly supporting and displaying all the key telemetry that is provided by Frsky Neuron Speed Controllers.  While designed for neuron, it will also support any system that outputs the telemetry using the standard Frsky Telemetry values.  For example the telemetry convertor by rclightsystems.com  will work perfectly with this widget.

Fully supported is:

- FPORT
- S.PORT
